     <p>The players may count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game, e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!", either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down with each syllable or holding it behind their back. They then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players throw immeidately on the third count, thus throwing on the count of "Scissors", or a version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing".</p>
 
     <p>Rock wins against scissors.
        Scissors win against paper.
        Paper wins against rock.
        If the same are drawn, its a draw. Rematch decides!</p>
